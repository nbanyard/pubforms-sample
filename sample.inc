Local \"Scooterists\" meet here on Sunday evenings and there is plenty of scooter memorabilia and scale models to admire. Thursday is quiz night and alternates between a hotly contested professional quiz, which entertains as well as taxing the brain muscles then Rock 'n' Roll bingo takes place on the next Thursday. A quieter saloon side bar provides a comfortable haven, while the main bar is more basic with a couple of TV screens, church pews and a real fire. Take care not to trip over Millie, the pub dog, as she races around the bar chasing the coloured lights reflected from the mirror globe. Snacks and pizzas are available all day. Unusually for the area the pub owns a piano. Good hanging basket displays feature in summer.",
